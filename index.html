        <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my professional portfolio. My name is Roger McNulty and I am a seasoned Systems Administrator with a strong background in Information Technology and a proven track record of excellence in both private and public sectors. With a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and extensive hands-on experience, I bring a wealth of technical expertise and a passion for optimizing IT systems to drive organizational success.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey began as a dedicated Marine, where I honed my leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving skills. I proudly served two tours in Iraq as a Marine Infantryman. After completing my service, I transitioned to the railroad industry where I worked over a decade as a Train Conductor at Pan Am Railways. There, I developed a keen sense of safety, system optimization, and data analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion for technology drove me to pursue a new path. I began working in the Litchfield School District as an IT Support Technician, where I managed IT projects, supported users, and maintained network infrastructure. I then joined BAE Systems as a Systems Administrator I, deploying and maintaining technology solutions in classified lab environments. My responsibilities included configuring server hardware and software, managing inventories, and securing Windows and Linux systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          My drive for technical excellence and leadership eventually brought me to Raytheon as a Systems Engineer II. I now manage and support both modern and legacy systems. I have recently taken on a major project supporting legacy platforms built on OpenVMS and Fortran, with the goal of becoming the in-house SME. I’m passionate about bridging the gap between legacy and modern systems in defense environments and reconnecting with my programming roots.
        </p>
        <p>
          My academic path began at Nashua Community College in Software Development, followed by a year at Middlesex Community College where I advanced through courses in Java and C++. I then completed a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Southern New Hampshire University with a 4.0 GPA and am now pursuing my MBA with a concentration in Project Management.
        </p>
        <p>
          My technical skills span platforms including Windows, Linux, virtualization technologies, cloud services, and programming languages. Beyond technical proficiency, I bring a calm and analytical approach to problem-solving, a collaborative and team-oriented mindset, and a dedication to exceptional customer service.
        </p>
